                    Hey there! My name is Anjali Prajapati, and I live in Mumbai, Nalasopara. I recently earned my
                    bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Shankar Narayan Arts and Commerce Degree College,
                    affiliated with the University of Mumbai since 2023.
                    Currently, I'm enrolled in a 9-month Java Full Stack Development course, where I'm enhancing my
                    skills in various programming languages like Java, web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, and database languages like SQL. I'm also getting hands-on experience with databases
                    like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLPlus. Alongside, I'm diving deep into development methodologies like
                    SDLC, waterfall model, agile model, scrum, VV model, and spiral model. As part of the course, I've
                    worked on several projects including Java, JDBC, Hibernate, and J2SE projects, as well as web-based
                    projects like Hospital Management System, Stellar website, games, and event management systems. I'm
                    continuously working on advancing my skills and knowledge for future projects.

                    My strengths lie in my adaptability, flexibility, effective communication, quick learning ability,
                    and keen interest in exploring new things. I'm always excited to push my boundaries and improve
                    myself.

                    Outside of academics and work, I enjoy listening to music, designing, traveling, and photography. In
                    the short term, my goal is to apply my skills and knowledge to a reputable company, while in the
                    long term, I'm highly motivated to become a software engineer.

                    I'm also passionate about volunteering and social work. I've participated in NSS camps, blood
                    donation drives, and various college functions and festivals. That's a little insight into who I am!
